NP =2
Checkerboard matrix vector multiplication
The result of Serial and Parallel Algorithm are the same. Good Job! 
 rows = 1000	cols = 1000	Serial Time = 0.003894s	OpenMP Time = 0.006629s	Speedup = 0.587378

NP =3
Checkerboard matrix vector multiplication
Results of parallel and Serial algorithm are not identical. Please check code
